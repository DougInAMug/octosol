# Comments on 0.0.1

0.0.1, as a first draft, is far from complete.

The main aim of the project—to feature the (cross-)quarter days—is lacking. I attempted to show the (c-)q days with symbols representing maxima, minima and mid-points of insolation (black-white) and temperature (blue-red), which I quite like, but I failed to see an easy way to include the name and relation to date at the time.

I realise now that this difficulty is due in part to the fact that the months and seasons are _ranges_ whereas the (c-)q days are _points_. Using the same graphical metaphor (such as in the [Celtic Ogham Year Wheel](https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/poster/8/10/break/images-medium-5/celtic-ogham-year-wheel-yuri-leitch.jpg) by Yuri Leitch) is a bit confusing. However, in calendars which more accurately display points, such as [strawdog's circular calendar](https://foulab.org/media/image/projects/strawdog/circular-calendar/calendar_2020.pdf), the points are often of least visual significance.

## Other observations
- the symbols are the only vertically oriented objects on the diagram: everything else radiates from the center. The symbols could be rotated in their axes inwards, or the gradiants could be circular/radial instead of linear.
- the white-black symbol looks a bit like a moon symbol... confusing?
- months are abbreviated. Is full-form nicer?
