# Comments on 0.1.0

## Changes from 0.0.1
- new display metaphor hopefully better reconciles ranges (season/months) and point ((cross-)quarter days)
- symbols changed to radial gradients
- full month names used

## Learned
- Layers are a nice way to add and keep guides
- Adding shortcuts is quite easy (added 'text to path' as ctrl+shift+p)
- Important to center text before putting on a path
  - should just have cursor somewehere in text, not have all text highlighted... bug?
- Can select _on top of_ object by holding down shift
- Can 'magic' select by holding down alt and drawing over objects to be selected
- Duplicate (ctrl+d) copies a selection and pastes it exactly where it was copied from
